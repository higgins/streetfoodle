# Street Foodle

Inspired by [Wordle]() and one of its derivatives
[Framed](https://framed.wtf/), Street Foodle is a daily guessing game
to guess street food from around the world.

You can [play it here](https://encapsulate.me/streetfoodle)

## Contributing

The street foods are sourced from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_street_foods) and
are likely to have images or descriptions you find insulting to the
dish in question. If so, considering editing the wikipedia page and
creating an issue in this repository.

At the time of publishing, there were only ~200 street foods listed in
the wikipedia article. This game will start over once all foods are
exhausted.


If you have a food you'd like to add, please consider editing the
wikipedia page before submitting the request here.

If you do update the wikipedia, be sure to let me know. The published
game is compiled and will not munge the wikpedia source live.
